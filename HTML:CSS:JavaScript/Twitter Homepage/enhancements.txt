I added a bar on the side with recommended accounts the user should follow based on their current list of followers and following. I used an ID labeled "recommendations" to declare the entire bar on the left side, then within that element, I added a header and then I added a separate div element for each page which included an icon of the account, the name, and the twitter handle (i.e., @Google). I also added a bar on the right side of the page which consists of the current trending topics. I used an ID labeled "trending" to declare the entire bar on the right side, then within that element, I added a header and then I added a separate div element for each trending topic. All classes made by me are at the bottom of the CSS file. Under the "What's Hot!" bar on the right side of the page, I added an "about" section with several different links leading to information about twitter.
